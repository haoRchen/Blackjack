*How to play BlackJack/21*
---

Objective:
Beat the dealer by attempting to get close to 21, without going over!

Card Value: 
Face cards = 10 | Ace = 1 or 11 | Other cards = face value

Betting:
The player can bet no more than his or her total chips

The Deck:
Will be reshuffled when only 20% of cards remain

The Deal:                                                                                         
Cards will be dealt alternating between the dealer and the player.                            
The dealer's first card will remain hidden, while all other cards dealt will be revealed      
                                                                                                  
Naturals:                                                                                          
If the player's first two cards equate to 21, it is a natural/blackjack.                       
If the player has a natural and the dealer does not, the player wins the round automatically  
Vice-versa for the dealer                                                                      
                                                                                                 
Player options:                                                                                    
1. Stand - Compare hand value with the dealer                                                
2. Hit - Receives an additional card from the deck.                                         
If player's hand value is over 21, then it is a bust.                                    
                                                                                          
Dealer's Play:                                                                                   
Once the player stands, the dealer must continue to draw until hand value is 17 or over.     
The player wins if dealer's hand value is over 21 (Bust)                                      
                                                                                          
Doubling Down:                                                                               
This option will be presented only when the hand value of the player is 9, 10 or 11 after      
the initial deal. The player can choose to place a bet equal to the original amount, 
and will receive one card from the dealer.
